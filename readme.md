MrVox is a toolkit writen in Matlab to simulate the Magnetic Resonance 
signal generated by a user-defined pulse sequence from a Voxel with 
a user-defined microscruture.


### What is this repository for? ###

* MrVox is for simulating the MR complex signal given by a voxel with a
user-defined microstructure when a user-defined pulse sequence is applied.
MrVox is designed with versatility in mind and user can control the geometry
of the voxel (size, number of blood vessels and cells, their size, their 
spacing, etc.), the relaxation properties of the different compartments 
(T1, T2), the magnetic field and its variation over the voxel dimension,
the water diffusion. 
* v1.0.0
