MrVox is a toolkit writen in Matlab to simulate the Magnetic Resonance 
signal


### What is MrVox for? ###

* MrVox is for simulating the MR complex signal given:

   1. a voxel with a user-defined microstructure
   2. a MR pulse sequence

* MrVox is designed with versatility in mind and user can control:

1. the geometry of the voxel (size, number of blood vessels and cells, their size, their spacing, etc.)
2. the MR-related properties of different compartments (T1, T2, M0, susceptibility)
3. the magnetic field and its variation over the voxel dimension
4. the water diffusion.
 
* MrVox is particularly designed to generate dictionaries of MR signals with varying input properties (blood volume, vessel size). For example, it has been used succesfully in the vascluar fingerprinting framework [(Christen et al. NeuroImage 20014)](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811913012019)

* current version is v1.0.0
