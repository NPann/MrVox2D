MrVox is a toolkit writen in Matlab to simulate the Magnetic Resonance 
signal


### What is MrVox for? ###

* MrVox is for simulating the MR complex signal given: 
** a voxel with a user-defined microstructure
** a MR pulse sequence
MrVox is designed with versatility in mind and user can control the geometry
of the voxel (size, number of blood vessels and cells, their size, their 
spacing, etc.), the relaxation properties of the different compartments 
(T1, T2), the magnetic field and its variation over the voxel dimension,
the water diffusion. 
* MrVox is particulary designed to generate dictionaries of MR signal when
varying voxel geometry and physiology
* current version is v1.0.0
